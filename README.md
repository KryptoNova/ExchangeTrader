# ExchangeTrader

This project has the hopes of being a totally redesigned trading/monitoring platform.  The inspiration for this project is taken from the Gekko project maintained by askmike.  However, it will be redesigned to be used with the Java language.  It will also be using MySQL as it's backend.  This will give much more flexibility and allow other reporting utilities to be used with it.

The other goal for this project is to monitor multiple assets for trend lines that may intersect.  This will allow the market base currance to be polled against the assets it is attributed to.  Thus, when Asset A begins to show signs of weakening, provided the charge for the round trip transfer to Asset B will net additional revenues, the trader will recommend this.  It will also execute the transfer when configured to do so.

In the beginning, the code will only have hooks to monitor and suggest these positions.  After a proof of concept period, the coding necessary to take the advice and make it so will be introduced.  Since this is something that can affect balances, this may be years away as I am only one person coding.
